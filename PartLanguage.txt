decorators:
	part 	# a list of one or more layers
	layer 	# a list of regions and/or layers. outlines from all regions are not allowed to cross.
			# their edges are allowed to overlap (That should be easy, just to check and let the results
			# speak for themselves ;) ).
	region 	# A single outline with an infill (infill could be one of three levels)
	infill 	# list of lines within a given outline
	outline	# Simple, closed, non-manifold, polygon
	
A region can have one of three infill levels:
1) an actual infill which will be printed
2) None - no infill will be printed
3) ... (ellipsis) - transparent - the next outer infill will be used

	numShells
	numBrims 	# Should numBrims be special and auto happen on only first layer? - Yes
				# Should brims be applied to regions of infill level None? - Yes
